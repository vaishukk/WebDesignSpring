    <p>
        I am currently, pursuing a master's degree in information systems from Northeastern University.
        She is interested in an Internship Job position opening at our Organization. In my first year at the university, I have taken up courses like Application Engineering and Development, Cloud Computing, Database Design, and Web Design.
        I have an experience as a Software Engineer for 2 years in implementing and providing various client requests on the development of the website and Environment setup.
        Aside from working for the Research and Development team in DevOps, I also have experience in training new and experienced employees, as well as in the recruitment team for recruiting highly qualified and deserving candidates.
        My experience heavily consists of SQL queries, JAVA application development including API calls, DevOps tools and AWS services for instance SonarQube, JIRA, Confluence, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, Packer, EC2, RDS, VPC, Lambda, etc.
        Built-up CI/CD pipeline using Git, maven, Jenkins, Docker for Java, and Middleware applications and automate the process using Terraform and AWS services. I also have an interest in implementing and exploring AWS services and DevOps tools.
        This helped my previous Organization gain a few clients as well the internal projects to solve issues which saved them at least a day or two's time.
